# Advanced_java

This project involves the development of interfaces and classes that adhere to best practices, such as the appropriate overriding of methods from the Object class, including the toString method, and implementing a static valueOf method where applicable. The coursework emphasizes the design of interface-based hierarchies, allowing for programming through interfaces and late binding, which promotes flexibility and scalability in software development. Furthermore, it explores the use of factory patterns to manage object instantiation, ensuring the creation of unique instances and enhancing code maintainability. Defensive programming principles, including immutability, are employed to safeguard the integrity of data and prevent unintended modifications. The coursework also incorporates appropriate classes and interfaces from the Collections framework to manage data effectively, alongside the use of Javadoc comments for thorough documentation of interfaces and classes, facilitating better understanding and usability of the code. Finally, unit testing is conducted using JUnit to validate the functionality and reliability of the implemented classes and interfaces, ensuring that the system meets its design specifications and performs as expected.
